# factory-simulation
This is a simulation for a production line which constucts lamps. The idea is to analyse how different rates of equipment failure effect the production. I completed this work as part of a University assignment.
## Scenario
There is a factory, which constructs lamps. I will only be studying 1 section of this factory. The section I will study has 2 critical machines, components queue at machine 1 until it is ready to process them. After the components have been processed in machine 1, they queue for machine 2. There is only 4 places in the queue for machine 2. This means that if machine 1 finishes processing components and there is no room in the queue for machine 2, machine 1 must stop until there is.
## Questions of Interest
1) is the space available in the queue for machine 2 sufficient?
2) Could the system be improved if machine 1 or machine 2 were made faster?
3) What would happen to the current system if the company had a successful advertising run and the rate of orders increased by 25%?
